# LeifGWCalc

Scientific calculator that correctly incorporates order of operations, including parenthesis.

Support for: "+","-","*","/","^","sin","cos","tan","log","ln" and some constants.

Easy and small too use. Can turn smaller by typing "small window".

This project was originally a quick mockup for school. Original task was making a simple calculator with 4 operator buttons and two inputs. I did a bit more.

Includes quotes from our lord and saviour Leif GW Persson.
