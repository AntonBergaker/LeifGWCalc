# LeifGWCalc

Calculator made for school that uses brackets, order of operations and is able to do trigenometri.
Easy and small too use.

This project was a quick mockup for school. We were given the tasks of making a simple calculator(like 4 operator buttons and two inputs). I did a bit more.

Includes quotes from our lord and saviour Leif GW Persson.
